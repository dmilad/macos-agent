It executed the command 'open -a Notes' which is the standard way to open applications via the command line on macOS. After issuing the command, the agent waited for 2 seconds to allow the application sufficient time to fully load and display its interface.\n\nOnce the Notes application was open and visible, the agent examined the left sidebar where tags are typically displayed in the Notes app. The agent systematically counted each tag present: #bm, #checklist, #home, #p44, #recipe, #shoveit, and #therapy. The final count revealed that the user has 7 tags in total in their Notes application. This was a straightforward task that required opening the application and performing a visual count of the displayed tags.",

      "narrative": "The task was to find and determine how many songs are in the MOMU playlist on Spotify. The user clarified that the playlist was specifically located in Spotify rather than another music application.\n\nThe agent took a direct approach by using a bash command to open the Spotify application. After waiting a few seconds for Spotify to fully load, the agent was able to see the Spotify interface with various playlists visible in the left sidebar.\n\nThe agent identified a pink \"MO\" icon in the sidebar that appeared to be the MOMU playlist and clicked on it. This successfully opened the playlist, which was titled \"\ud83d\udd25 momu 2023 \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\". The playlist information clearly displayed that it contains 72 songs with a total duration of 6 hours and 58 minutes. The playlist was created by ckbw and 6 others, and had received 8 saves from users.",

      "narrative": "The task was to determine how many p44-related messages exist in the Notes application on a macOS system. The user wanted a count of all notes that contain references to 'p44', which appears to be a tag or project identifier used to organize their notes.\n\nThe agent approached this systematically by first opening the Notes application using the bash command 'open -a Notes'. After waiting for the application to launch, the agent noticed that Notes had a sidebar with various folders and tags, including a '#p44' tag that was visible in the left sidebar. The agent clicked on this tag to filter notes by that specific tag.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive view of all p44-related content, the agent then used the search functionality. By clicking on the search box in the top right corner of the Notes window and typing 'p44', the search results displayed all notes containing 'p44' in their content or tags. The results showed at least 7 notes organized into 'Top Hits' and 'Notes' sections, including items like '#p44 performance', '#p44 knowledge b...', 'interview notes', 'Belgrade', 'ethics point Report', 'ask anju for design', and 'NEXT 3'. The agent scrolled through the search results to ensure all p44-related notes were visible and counted.",

      "request_text": "open Notes and tell me how many bm related messages i have",
      "narrative": "The task was to open the Notes application on macOS and determine how many BM-related messages the user has stored.\n\nThe agent began by launching the Notes application using the bash command:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"bash\",\n    \"action\": \"open -a Notes\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"command\": \"open -a Notes\"\n    },\n    \"output\": \"\",\n    \"error\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"computer\",\n    \"action\": \"wait\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"duration\": 2\n    },\n    \"output\": null,\n    \"error\": null\n  }\n}\n\nAfter waiting for the application to fully load, the agent observed that Notes had organized content with tags in the left sidebar. Conveniently, there was already a \"#bm\" tag visible in the Tags section, which suggested that the user had previously tagged BM-related notes for easy filtering.\n\nThe agent clicked on the #bm tag to filter and display only the notes associated with this tag:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"computer\",\n    \"action\": \"left_click\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"action\": \"left_click\",\n      \"coordinate\": [\n        33,\n        273\n      ]\n    },\n    \"output\": null,\n    \"error\": null\n  }\n}\n\nThis revealed three notes in the middle column, all dated December 1, 2024. To verify the count and ensure these were distinct notes, the agent systematically clicked through each of the three notes:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"computer\",\n    \"action\": \"left_click\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"action\": \"left_click\",\n      \"coordinate\": [\n        213,\n        240\n      ]\n    },\n    \"output\": null,\n    \"error\": null\n  }\n}\n\nThe second note was titled \"welcome to the vacant heart of the wild west\" and confirmed the #bm tag. The agent then clicked on the third note:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"computer\",\n    \"action\": \"left_click\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"action\": \"left_click\",\n      \"coordinate\": [\n        213,\n        302\n      ]\n    },\n    \"output\": null,\n    \"error\": null\n  }\n}\n\nThis note contained information about WiFi login procedures at what appeared to be a Burning Man event, confirming that \"BM\" stands for \"Burning Man.\" Finally, the agent verified the first note:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"computer\",\n    \"action\": \"left_click\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"action\": \"left_click\",\n      \"coordinate\": [\n        213,\n        181\n      ]\n    },\n    \"output\": null,\n    \"error\": null\n  }\n}\n\nThe first note, titled \"last 2,\" contained a checklist and was also tagged with #bm. Through this methodical verification process, the agent confirmed that the user has exactly **3 BM-related messages** in their Notes app, all from December 2024 and all related to Burning Man.",
