  "narrative": "The task was to find and determine how many songs are in the MOMU playlist on Spotify. The user clarified that the playlist was specifically located in Spotify rather than another music application.\n\nThe agent took a direct approach by using a bash command to open the Spotify application. After waiting a few seconds for Spotify to fully load, the agent was able to see the Spotify interface with various playlists visible in the left sidebar.\n\nThe agent identified a pink \"MO\" icon in the sidebar that appeared to be the MOMU playlist and clicked on it. This successfully opened the playlist, which was titled \"\ud83d\udd25 momu 2023 \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\". The playlist information clearly displayed that it contains 72 songs with a total duration of 6 hours and 58 minutes. The playlist was created by ckbw and 6 others, and had received 8 saves from users."
